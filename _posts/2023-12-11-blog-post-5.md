The OOD baseline paper titled _"A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks"_ is one of the most important research paper in OOD detection literature. Though the paper is not mathematically and technically heavy, it certainly has some concepts that might not be straightforward for beginners. The discussion and/or tutorial of the paper has been lacking in the internet. Hence, to help the beginners dive into the field of out-of-distribution detection and make it easier for beginners to fully understand the concepts of the paper, I have written an explainer blog.
